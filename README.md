# ⚡ MzanziGrid ZA

**MzanziGrid ZA** is a community-driven web platform that helps South Africans report and track unplanned electricity disruptions — especially those caused by cable theft, transformer explosions, and infrastructure sabotage. Built to serve township communities like Ekurhuleni, the platform empowers users to share real-time updates, view outage maps, and access recovery resources.

## 🌍 Why It Matters

In many South African townships, power outages go beyond load shedding. Entire areas can be left in darkness for weeks or months due to stolen cables or damaged transformers. MzanziGrid ZA gives communities a voice, helps track incidents, and supports faster recovery.
